    /// - They can run normally (default)
    /// - They can run reversed with the reverse method
    /// - They can run with the time altered with the Accelerate, AccelDeccel and Speed actions.
    ///    For example, you can simulate a Ping Pong effect running the action normally and
    ///  then running it again in Reverse mode.
