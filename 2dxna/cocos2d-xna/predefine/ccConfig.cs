/*
 * The usage of #define is defferent from c++. It can not assign the value the the macro, such as
 * #define XXX 1
 * And it only make effect in the file define it. It means that, macro A defined in file1.cs can not
 * be use in file2.cs.
 * So I should define the macros in project configuration. If the value of the macro is 0, then not
 * define it. The macro will be define like:
 * #define A
 * #define A 1
 * 
 * If the macro like this
 * #define A 0
 * It will not be defined. Take attension this, in c++, it is defined, but the value is 0.
 * 
 * Macros defined are:
 * CC_FONT_LABEL_SUPPORT
 * CC_DIRECTOR_FAST_FPS
 * CC_DIRECTOR_MAC_USE_DISPLAY_LINK_THREAD
 * CC_COCOSNODE_RENDER_SUBPIXEL
 * CC_SPRITEBATCHNODE_RENDER_SUBPIXEL
 * #define CC_USES_VBO 1
 * CC_NODE_TRANSFORM_USING_AFFINE_MATRIX
 * CC_OPTIMIZE_BLEND_FUNC_FOR_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA
 * 
 * Macros not defined are:
 * CC_FIX_ARTIFACTS_BY_STRECHING_TEXEL
 * CC_DIRECTOR_DISPATCH_FAST_EVENTS
 * CC_TEXTURE_ATLAS_USE_TRIANGLE_STRIP
 * CC_TEXTURE_NPOT_SUPPORT
 * CC_RETINA_DISPLAY_SUPPORT
 * CC_USE_LA88_LABELS_ON_NEON_ARCH
 * CC_SPRITE_DEBUG_DRAW
 * CC_SPRITEBATCHNODE_DEBUG_DRAW
 * CC_LABELBMFONT_DEBUG_DRAW
 * CC_LABELATLAS_DEBUG_DRAW
 * CC_ENABLE_PROFILERS
 * CC_IS_RETINA_DISPLAY_SUPPORTED
 * 
 * 
 * CC_DIRECTOR_FPS_INTERVAL and CC_RETINA_DISPLAY_FILENAME_SUFFIX are defined in ccMacros.cs.
